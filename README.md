# Sign ClickOnce App (SignClickOnceApp.ps1)
**A PowerShell Script to correctly sign a ClickOnce Application using a SHA256 Certificate.**

This should not be required for Visual Studio 2019 and newer, which appear to sign packages with a SHA256 certificate
correctly.

Microsoft ClickOnce Applications Signed with a SHA256 Certificate show as Unknown Publisher during installation,
ClickOnce Applications signed with a SHA1 Certificate show an Unknown Publisher SmartScreen Warning once installed, this
happens because:

1) The ClickOnce installer only supports SHA1 certificates (not SHA256) without a specific override when signing, but,
2) Microsoft has depreciated SHA1 for Authenticode Signing.
    
This script signs the various parts of the ClickOnce Application so that both the ClickOnce Installer and SmartScreen do
not alert for this reason. SmartScreen may still show Unknown Publisher based on unknown conditions it uses to determine
trustworthiness.
